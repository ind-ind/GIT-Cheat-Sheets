## Styling

- Use `###` headers for your sections.
- Also use `###` for categories (these should group together relevant sections) and `####` for subcategories.
- Add a link to your section/category to the contents section (use relative links).
- Make sure to include examples wherever possible (preferably GIFs).
- For command-line examples, wrap your commands in a `bash` code block.
- At the end of your section, add a `Read more about...` link. This should directly link to [Git's](http://git-scm.com/docs), [GitHub's](https://help.github.com), or the relevant documentation.
- If your contribution is a translation, add a (relative) link to the README above the [Table of Contents](README.md#table-of-contents).
